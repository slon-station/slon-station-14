  Gangs have 2 types of members, a Leader and a Member.
  Gang leader spawns with a gang radio and a gang spray painter.

  ## Basic knowledge

  Gang leaders does not have any markings, so they are hard to identify.
  Gang leaders (and members) can use gang radios to get locations of the gang tip-off crates. Every 8 minutes, there would be an announcement on the gang radio of the location of the drop, that will happen in 2 minutes.

  Tip-off crates may contain weapons, armor, clothing and drugs, which are a good way to gain weapons to eliminate other gangs.
  Gang radios are obtainable from tip-off crates, and roundstart in the leaders backpacks.


  There are a maximum of 6 possible gangs, every gang has their own hat, [italic]their gang marking.[/italic]
  The main objective of gang wars: Tag the most walls using your gang spray, and get rid of every other gang leader. But that is a no-easy task!
  Because every time a gang leader dies, one random person from their gang becomes a new leader.

  Gang members shouldn't conflict with security, following the escalation rules.

  Every gang has their own marking, their own hat.

  Every gang member has those forced on them once they've joined a gang.
